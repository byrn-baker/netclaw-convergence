# Feature Specification: Convergence for ordinary home labs

Created: 2026-10-30. Branch: `1012-convergence-home-onboarding`.
Status: User-authorized implementation; Linux first.

## User scenarios and acceptance

### US1 — Try retained traffic evidence without network equipment (P1)
A user with one Linux computer and local Docker can start an isolated example,
produce clearly labeled demonstration flows, and inspect retained summary/evidence.
No Cisco switch, Proxmox, Kubernetes, device credentials or model subscription is
required. Demo observations must never be presented as the user's network traffic.

### US2 — Observe this Linux computer (P1)
A user can explicitly select a local interface for software flow export into the
same collector/archive/API path. The instructions explain permissions and scope;
no capture starts during preparation and no host routing or firewall is changed.
An isolated Linux network namespace with real generated traffic qualifies the
software exporter pipeline; physical adapters and whole-home coverage are separate.

### US3 — Select capabilities honestly (P1)
Guidance distinguishes demonstration, host traffic, router-exported network flows
and optional packet IDS. Missing hardware/source is not an unhealthy core service.
The API/HUD identify demo or host-only coverage, and not-configured/empty/unavailable
states remain distinct. K3s remains the persistent option, Docker the easy entry.

## Requirements

- FR001: Reuse private bundle generation and project isolation; new collection is opt-in.
- FR002: Pin service versions; keep ingest/query endpoints private by default. Never
  expose the Docker socket or auto-discover/capture an interface during setup.
- FR003: Demonstration and host-only identities/coverage must be explicit and separate;
  no silent synthetic data injection into an existing real installation.
- FR004: Persist retained flow data across restart; bound retention and document
  collector spool/queue storage and loss/duplication limits.
- FR005: Verify software export through real collector/storage/API and existing HUD
  components, including authorization, scope and same-window evidence.
- FR006: Report measured resource use for the actual small test, without claiming a
  capacity minimum or qualifying Mac/WSL/physical interfaces without execution.
- FR007: Keep upstream's agreed two-tool/view connector scope unchanged. Record the
  user's maintainer scope approval in proposal161; integration port remains later work.

## Success criteria and exclusions

A contributor follows a reproducible Linux Docker path to nonempty retained evidence
without special networking equipment, then stops only their project. Fresh setup,
repeat preparation, restart, negative access and missing-source behavior are tested.
Existing core/K3s setup is preserved. No live network, IDS, router, hypervisor,
production telemetry migration or automated investigations are changed.
