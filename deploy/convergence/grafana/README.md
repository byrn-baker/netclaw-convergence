# Convergence Grafana — holistic suite (Phase 10)

## Access

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **URL** | **http://127.0.0.1:3300** (not :3000) |
| **Folder** | Convergence |
| **Primary boards** | **Network** · **Security** · **NetClaw** |

Cross-links between the three boards are in each dashboard header.

## The three boards

### 1. Network (`convergence-network`)

Site-wide network health as one story:

| Section | Data |
|---------|------|
| Site overview | `convergence:health_score`, WAN latency/loss, SNMP/Wi‑Fi counts |
| WAN | blackbox `probe_success` / latency |
| Campus switching | named `interface_*` traffic, ports up, errors, down table |
| Wi‑Fi | UniFi clients, TX retries, AP uplink |
| Edge | blackbox edge HTTPS |

### 2. Security (`convergence-security`)

Posture and access, not random stats:

| Section | Data |
|---------|------|
| Posture KPIs | firing/critical ALERTS, edge mgmt, UniFi up, guest clients |
| Active alerts | `ALERTS{alertstate="firing"}` table (+ investigate label) |
| Edge & wireless | edge probe, guest vs wireless clients |
| Syslog / auth | Loki `device-syslog`, block/deny keywords, login noise |

**Data needs:** devices send syslog → host **:1514** (udp or tcp) →
**otel-collector** → Loki (14d) + VictoriaLogs (365d). Vendor-default RFC3164 is
parsed into structured fields; see `adapters/device-syslog/README.md`. Without a
syslog source the log panels stay empty while posture/alert/edge/wireless panels
still work (spec FR-033).

Log panels query **structured fields**, not labels:
`{job="device-syslog"} | json | attributes_appname="filterlog"`. Labels stay a
bounded set (`device_name`, `site`, `job`, `service_name`, `level`) — `appname`
and Cisco `mnemonic` are fields precisely so they cannot explode stream count.

Ingest health is scraped (`job=otel-collector`) and alerted on
(`SyslogIngestRefusing`, `LogExportFailing`, `SyslogIngestNoEntries`,
`LogIngestDown`), because the original failure mode here was a **silent** drop:
port open, packets arriving, Loki empty.

### 3. NetClaw (`convergence-netclaw`)

Agent plane end-to-end:

| Section | Data |
|---------|------|
| LLM by provider | `netclaw_model_*` rates + cost by `provider` / `model` / `agent` |
| Totals | input tokens table, sessions, USD total |
| Investigation pipe | alerts received, T0/T1/T2 tiers, suppressions, budget trips |
| Gateway & N2N logs | OpenClaw files + journal mesh/member units, selected by `job`/`unit` labels |

**Data needs:**

| Source | How |
|--------|-----|
| Token/cost metrics | `openclaw-token-exporter` → Prom job `netclaw-openclaw` (:9110) |
| Investigation metrics | host `alert-receiver` → Prom job `netclaw-alert-receiver` (:8099) |
| Gateway logs | host `/tmp/openclaw/*.log` mounted into promtail |
| Mesh / N2N / members | promtail journal scrape of systemd *user units* (`job=netclaw-mesh`, `job=netclaw-member`) |

### Reading an empty log panel

Log panels select streams by label (`job`, `unit`, `app`, `device_name`) — never by
message-content regex, which cannot distinguish "no matching wording" from "no
data" (spec FR-034). An empty panel therefore means the source is not deployed or
the unit is idle, not that the query missed. Mesh/member units in particular are
event-driven and can sit quiet for a day; promtail's journal window is 7d so their
recent history survives a collector restart.

Confirm which panels resolve to real streams:

```bash
./deploy/convergence/smoke-log-panels.sh      # OK / EMPTY / FAIL per panel
```

## Datasource UIDs

| UID | Service |
|-----|---------|
| `prometheus` | Prometheus :9090 |
| `loki` | Loki :3100 |
| `victoriametrics-longterm` | VictoriaMetrics (optional long-term; primary boards use Prometheus) |

## Legacy boards

Pilot/ported JSON lives under `provisioning/dashboards/legacy/` and is **not**
provisioned. Re-enable only if you intentionally re-add files to `json/`.

## Reload after changes

```bash
cd deploy/convergence
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.full.yml --env-file .env \
  up -d promtail grafana
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9090/-/reload
# Open http://127.0.0.1:3300 → Convergence → Network | Security | NetClaw
```
