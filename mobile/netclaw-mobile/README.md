# NetClaw Mobile

Flutter (iOS + Android, one codebase) client app for the NCFED Edge Node profile.
A thin client — no LLM, no local agent reasoning. Connects outbound to a NetClaw
Border Claw, advertises device-native capabilities (camera, biometric approval,
location, etc.), and renders whatever the Border sends back.

Feature 066 (this repo's `specs/066-netclaw-mobile-ncfed-edge/`) covers the protocol
foundation: enrollment and the Border-to-phone push channel. Feature 067
(`specs/067-ncfed-mobile-command-channel/`) adds the reverse direction — asking the
Border something from the phone (text, voice, or a scanned device QR/deep link).
Feature 068 (`specs/068-ncfed-mobile-biometrics-capture/`) adds two more slices on
top of both: Border-triggered approvals resolved on the phone with device
biometrics (Face ID/fingerprint), and camera/mic capture in either direction
(attach a photo to your own request, or let the Border request one from you).

## Running against a local Border

1. On the Border, set `N2N_CLAW_DOMAIN` and `N2N_EDGE_WS_PORT` in `.env` and restart
   the daemon (`mcp-servers/protocol-mcp/bgp-daemon-v2.py`).
2. Issue a QR: `netclaw risk token --edge [label]`.
3. `flutter pub get`, then `flutter run` (Android) to launch the app and scan it.
   No usable camera (emulator, Simulator)? Tap **"Can't scan? Enter manually"** on
   the enrollment screen and type the domain, port, and token instead — it
   synthesizes exactly the payload a scan would produce.

Once enrolled, the app persists the enrollment (`enrollment_store.dart`) and
redials automatically on restart or a dropped connection, so steps 2–3 are
one-time. A Border that revokes the device returns `-32023`, which drops the app
back to the enrollment screen rather than retrying forever.

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## Building a release

`flutter build appbundle` reads signing material from `android/key.properties` —
copy [`android/key.properties.example`](android/key.properties.example) and fill
it in:

```properties
storeFile=/absolute/path/to/upload-keystore.jks
storePassword=…
keyAlias=upload
keyPassword=…
```

That file and any `*.jks`/`*.keystore` are gitignored and must never be
committed. **If it's absent the build still succeeds but signs with the debug
key** (Gradle prints a warning) — such an artifact cannot be uploaded to Play.
The release build type has R8 minification and resource shrinking enabled; keep
rules live in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`.

To put a build on someone's phone rather than a store, see
[`SIDELOAD.md`](SIDELOAD.md).

### What a fresh clone needs

Everything required to build is tracked **except** the things that must not be:

- `android/gradlew`, `android/gradlew.bat` and `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
  are gitignored by Flutter's own template. **Build with `flutter build`, not a
  raw `./gradlew`** — the Flutter tool regenerates the wrapper. Running
  `./gradlew` directly in a fresh clone will simply not find it.
- `android/local.properties` is generated by the Flutter tool from your SDK
  paths; never commit it.
- `android/key.properties` and any keystore — see above.
- **`ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` carries a committed
  `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` (`A49777FMJG`, the maintainer's).** Anyone else must
  replace it with their own team in Xcode before iOS will sign. iOS uses Swift
  Package Manager, so there is no `Podfile` to install — open
  `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, not the `.xcodeproj`.

## Push notifications

Push is **decided in scope for v1** and the app-side code is complete: token
registration (`lib/ncfed/push_registration.dart`), notification-tap deep-linking
(`lib/ncfed/notification_deep_link.dart`), failure classification, and a status
row on the Settings tab so a broken push setup is visible rather than silent.

What is **not** in the repo, and never will be, is the Firebase configuration —
it carries per-operator project IDs and API keys. Without it the app builds and
runs completely normally; it just reports "Notifications unavailable" and
answers only arrive while the app is open.

To enable push for your own deployment:

1. Create a Firebase project and register both apps under the bundle ID
   `ca.automateyournetwork.netclaw.mobile` (or your own, if you changed it).
2. **Android** — download `google-services.json` into `android/app/`. The
   `com.google.gms.google-services` Gradle plugin is applied automatically once
   that file exists (it is skipped, with a log line, when it doesn't — the
   plugin hard-fails the build otherwise, which would break every fresh clone).
3. **iOS** — download `GoogleService-Info.plist` into `ios/Runner/`, generate an
   **APNs auth key** (`.p8`) in the Apple Developer portal, and upload it to
   Firebase → Project settings → Cloud Messaging.
4. **iOS capabilities** — in Xcode, Runner target → Signing & Capabilities → add
   **Push Notifications** and **Background Modes → Remote notifications**.
   `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements` is prepared for this but deliberately not
   yet referenced by the build, because **a free Xcode Personal Team cannot sign
   the Push Notifications capability** and enabling it early breaks device
   builds. This step needs paid Apple Developer Program membership.

All three config files are gitignored.

Toolchain versions this project is known to build with: **Flutter 3.44.8**,
**JDK 17** (Gradle 9.1.0 / AGP 9.0.1 / Kotlin 2.3.20 fail confusingly on newer
JDKs — pin with `flutter config --jdk-dir=…` rather than changing a system-wide
`JAVA_HOME`), Android SDK **platform 36 / build-tools 36.0.0**, and — for iOS —
**Xcode 26.6**.

The app ships with no hostnames or credentials — it is a generic NCFED edge
client, bound to whichever Border enrolls it. Any reference to
`netclaw.automateyournetwork.ca` in this repo is the maintainer's own test
Border, not a dependency.

## Platform-specific notes

- **Android**: builds and runs on any Linux/Mac/Windows machine with the Android
  SDK — no macOS required. Verified for real in this repo's own dev environment:
  a debug APK was built (`flutter build apk --debug`), installed and launched on
  an Android emulator (API 34, x86_64, KVM-accelerated), the real
  `mobile_scanner`/`CameraX` camera-permission dialog and a live emulated camera
  preview both rendered correctly inside `EnrollmentScreen`, and a full enrollment
  + `n2n/edge/ask` handshake completed against a real (throwaway, non-production)
  Border daemon over `wss://`. `MainActivity.kt`'s `EdgeIdentityPlugin`
  (AndroidKeyStore-backed) links and runs without crashing; its actual key
  generation/signing behavior has not been separately exercised end-to-end (no QR
  containing a real payload was presented to the emulator's synthetic camera feed).
  Feature 068 was verified the same way: a fresh debug APK (now linking `local_auth`
  and `camera` on top of everything above, and with `MainActivity` changed to
  `FlutterFragmentActivity`) built, installed, and launched cleanly on the same
  emulator — `logcat` showed no Dart/Flutter exception and the activity reached
  `topResumedActivity`, confirming the new native plugins don't crash on startup.
  Biometric approval and a real photo capture were NOT exercised here — this
  emulator has no provisioned fingerprint/Face-unlock enrollment and its virtual
  camera only produces a synthetic test pattern, not a real capture; both need
  either a real device or a properly provisioned emulator, done in a later pass.
  **A full production round trip has since been verified** (2026-07-25): a question
  asked from the emulated phone against the operator's real Border fanned out to
  the `cml` and `pyats` risk members and returned a 1583-byte answer to the handset
  in 2m13s, with GAIT audit records for each delegation. Enrollment, the edge WS
  transport, delegation/routing, and result delivery are all proven end to end.
- **iOS** (status as of spec `071-ios-mobile-port`, 2026-07-26 — see that spec's
  `tasks.md` for the authoritative, evolving record): **the app now builds,
  installs, and launches cleanly on the iOS Simulator.** Xcode 26.6 and Flutter
  3.44.8 were installed on the operator's Mac, and the first-ever
  `flutter build ios --debug --simulator` attempt surfaced (and fixed) two real
  blockers that no amount of code review could have found without an actual
  compiler run — see `specs/071-ios-mobile-port/research.md` D8 for full detail:
  1. `firebase-core`/`firebase-messaging`'s Swift Package Manager products
     require iOS 15.0 minimum; `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` was still the
     Flutter template's `13.0`. Bumped to `15.0` in
     `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (all 3 occurrences) — a
     build-config change only, no app behavior affected.
  2. `EdgeIdentityPlugin.swift` and `X509SelfSigned.swift` — both written
     without Xcode access — had genuinely **never been added to the Xcode
     project at all** (zero `PBXFileReference`/`PBXBuildFile`/Sources-phase
     entries). The build failed with `Cannot find 'EdgeIdentityPlugin' in
     scope`, confirming this file had truly never compiled. Fixed by adding
     both files to the `Runner` target via the `xcodeproj` Ruby gem
     (equivalent to dragging them into Xcode and checking "Add to target").
  After both fixes: `flutter build ios --debug --simulator` succeeds
  (`✓ Built build/ios/iphonesimulator/Runner.app`), and `xcrun simctl
  install`/`launch` confirm the app runs without crashing — the Dart VM
  service starts, and it correctly lands on the "Scan Border QR Code"
  enrollment screen (`EnrollmentGate` routing works) with a real system
  camera-permission dialog showing the exact `NSCameraUsageDescription` text
  from `Info.plist`. This is strong evidence `EdgeIdentityPlugin.register(with:)`
  runs at launch without crashing.
  - **Still unverified — needs a real device**: Secure Enclave key
    generation/signing, Face ID, and a real camera feed are all unavailable on
    the Simulator regardless of tooling. This needs a signing team selected in
    Xcode (requires the operator's own Apple ID — an interactive step no agent
    can do) and a physically connected iPhone. Neither was available as of this
    pass.
  - **Still unverified — needs interactive tapping**: the "Can't scan? Enter
    manually" fallback screen was reached in principle (the enrollment screen
    rendered correctly) but never actually tapped through and submitted — no
    CLI-only UI-automation tool was available/attempted for that.
  - `AppDelegate.swift` uses the stock `FlutterAppDelegate` with no
    `FlutterFragmentActivity`-style change, and the app launched successfully
    with it — consistent with the expectation that iOS's `local_auth` needs no
    such change, though the actual Face ID prompt itself is still unconfirmed
    (needs a real device).
  Remaining work: `specs/071-ios-mobile-port/tasks.md` Phase 1 (T004/T005,
  both requiring the operator's hands) through the rest of the task list.
- **watchOS** (spec `072-apple-watch-companion`, 2026-07-27): a native SwiftUI
  watch companion app (`mobile/netclaw-mobile/ios/WatchApp Watch App/`) that
  relays everything through the paired iPhone's already-running NetClaw Mobile
  app via `WatchConnectivity` — it has no identity, enrollment, or network
  connection of its own (FR-011). **Verified end to end on real hardware**
  (a physical Apple Watch Series 7, watchOS 26.6, paired with the iPhone from
  spec 071's real-device verification) — not just the Simulator, which hit an
  unresolved rendering quirk (backend message exchange succeeded per device
  logs, but the watch UI never visibly progressed past a spinner) and was set
  aside in favor of hardware. All four tabs confirmed working against a real
  Border: Approvals (approve/deny with a fresh on-device passcode confirmation
  per FR-003, correctly attributed as `confirmation_method: "watch_passcode"`
  — never `"biometric"` — on the Border's own audit record), Feed (read-only
  pushed messages), Ask (dictated/typed question through the same
  `n2n/edge/ask` path as the phone's chat), and History (an addition beyond
  the original three-capability scope, added after real-device testing showed
  the operator wanted past chat Q&A visible on the wrist).
  - Getting a real watch discoverable in Xcode at all required unpairing and
    re-trusting the paired iPhone in Xcode's Devices and Simulators window —
    the watch's connection is proxied entirely through the phone's own trust
    relationship with the Mac, not established independently.
  - A cross-SDK build trap cost significant time: `xcodebuild -sdk
    iphonesimulator`/`-sdk iphoneos` as a blunt global flag forces that SDK
    onto every target in the build graph, including the embedded watchOS
    dependency — breaking `WCSessionDelegate` conformance with confusing
    "does not conform to protocol" errors. Fixed by using `-destination
    'id=<device>'` exclusively and never `-sdk`.
  - A Release-configuration build of `Runner` (needed to run the phone app
    without Xcode attached at all — a Flutter debug/JIT build refuses to
    launch without the tooling attached) originally hit a second variant of
    the same platform-bleed problem: even with a concrete `-destination`,
    Xcode's implicit build of the embedded `WatchApp` dependency compiled it
    against an iOS deployment target, breaking watchOS 10+-only APIs
    (`ContentUnavailableView`) and `WCSessionDelegate` conformance
    identically. **Root cause found and fixed (2026-07-29):** the `WatchApp`
    target inherited `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = iphoneos` from the project while
    its own `SDKROOT`/`PLATFORM_NAME` were `watchos` — that mismatch is what
    forced the embedded (and even standalone-scheme) build into an iOS
    context. Setting `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = "watchos watchsimulator"` on all
    three `WatchApp` build configurations resolves it. `flutter build ios
    --release` now produces one Release archive with **both** apps properly
    embedded (`Runner.app/Watch/WatchApp.app`); installing that phone build
    provisions the watch companion to the paired Apple Watch automatically —
    no more detach/restore workaround, no separately-installed Debug watch
    build. Verified end to end: combined Release build installed to the
    physical iPhone (466) with the watch app embedded, feature `073`.
- **Real local push notifications, unread tracking, and cross-device sync**
  (spec `073-push-notifications-sync`, 2026-07-29): the phone now posts an
  actual local notification (via `flutter_local_notifications`, not the
  credential-blocked remote FCM/APNs path below) for a new Feed message, a
  completed chat answer, or a new approval — while the app process is alive,
  foreground or backgrounded. Approval notifications carry inline
  Approve/Deny actions gated by `DarwinNotificationActionOption
  .authenticationRequired` AND the exact same fresh, never-cached biometric
  confirmation the in-app buttons use (extracted into
  `lib/ncfed/approval_confirmation.dart`, now the one shared entry point for
  both). The watch inherits every notification and the combined app badge
  purely via standard watchOS mirroring — no new watch-side
  background-delivery code was added (confirmed by code review, FR-010).
  `MessageFeedStore`/`ConversationStore` gained per-item `acknowledged` state
  (with a load-bearing migration rule: a message/turn written before this
  feature shipped defaults to *already acknowledged* on load, not unread —
  getting that backwards would have made every pre-existing item appear new
  the moment an operator upgraded) plus `acknowledge()`/`delete()`, exposed
  on both phone screens and the watch's Feed/History tabs (swipe actions),
  and four new watch-relay methods. A real, pre-existing defect is also fixed
  here: `watch_relay.dart`'s `_submitAsk`/`_askStatus` now actually record
  into the shared `ConversationStore` (with `origin: "watch"`) — previously
  a question asked from the watch never appeared in the phone's Chat tab or
  the watch's own History tab at all. The watch's Feed/History/Ask views
  gained an on-demand "read aloud" control (`SpeechPlayback.swift`,
  `AVSpeechSynthesizer`) that only ever speaks on an explicit tap.
  - **Verified**: all Dart-side logic (stores, relay methods, notification
    payload/dedup/badge helpers, the generalized `NotificationDeepLink`
    dispatcher, the Border's `already_resolved` addition) via the automated
    suite — `flutter analyze` clean, full `flutter test` suite passing with
    zero regressions, `python3 -m pytest tests/n2n` passing. All new watchOS
    Swift code (`FeedView.swift`/`HistoryView.swift`/`AskView.swift`/
    `WatchDataStore.swift`/`SpeechPlayback.swift`) compiles cleanly against
    the real, physical Apple Watch from spec 072 (`xcodebuild ... -destination
    'id=<device>' build` succeeded).
  - **Not yet verified**: the actual on-device behavior of every capability
    above (notification banners actually appearing, the watch's own
    home-screen badge mirroring per FR-009, swipe-to-acknowledge/delete on
    real hardware, the notification-tap authenticated-action flow, read-aloud
    audibly speaking) — this needs the operator physically present with both
    devices unlocked and nearby, which wasn't available for this pass. Do
    not assume this works from a clean compile alone; a real-hardware pass
    matching spec 072's own verification standard is the next step before
    this can be marked fully done.
- Push-notification delivery (FCM/APNs, feature 066 US3) needs real Firebase/Apple
  Developer credentials configured on the Border (`.env.example`'s
  `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`/`APNS_*` vars) and a real `Firebase.initializeApp()`
  setup in the app (`google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist`) — neither
  exists in this repo; wire them in with your own project's credentials. Note that
  `main.dart`'s `_tryRegisterPush()` swallows the resulting failure to a
  `debugPrint`, so **push silently does nothing rather than erroring** until those
  credentials exist. Notification-tap deep-linking is wired on the same success
  path: it jumps to the Feed tab and highlights the referenced message. Since
  spec 107 that works even when the message has not arrived yet — the tap records
  a `PendingOpenIntent` (`lib/ncfed/pending_open_intent.dart`) which resolves when
  the message lands, or gives up after 8s. Foreground pushes are also recorded
  straight from their data payload (`lib/ncfed/push_message_ingest.dart`), so a
  pushed message is readable without a live channel; `MessageFeedStore.append`
  deduplicates on `pushed_at`, which is what stops that path and the Border's
  replay from each storing their own copy.
- Voice transcription (`speech_to_text`, feature 067 US4) and the device deep link
  (`app_links`, feature 067 US5) are wired in and pass their unit tests, but — like
  push notifications — haven't been exercised against a real microphone or a real
  tapped/scanned link on either platform.
- Feature 068's `local_auth`/`camera` packages need no manual `AndroidManifest.xml`
  permission entries — both merge their own required permissions (`CAMERA`,
  `RECORD_AUDIO`, `USE_BIOMETRIC`) in automatically via Gradle manifest merging.
  `INTERNET` is the exception and **is** declared explicitly in
  `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`: it previously reached release builds
  only as a merge side-effect of `firebase_messaging`, so dropping that dependency
  would have silently broken networking in release with no compile-time error. On
  iOS, `local_auth`'s Face ID needs `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` (Touch ID/Android's
  BiometricPrompt need no key at all) — added to `Info.plist` alongside the
  existing camera/microphone keys, which now also cover the `camera` package's
  photo/video capture use (not exercised on iOS, same Xcode/Mac caveat as above).
- **1.0.1 polish pass** (spec `109-mobile-polish-pass`, 2026-08-15, version bumped
  `1.0.0+1` → `1.0.1+2`): dark mode (a proper dark `ColorScheme`, `themeMode:
  ThemeMode.system`, a repo-hygiene test locking the color-literal sweep in going
  forward), selectable/copyable/shareable Markdown-or-preformatted rendering for
  chat answers and Feed messages (`flutter_markdown_plus` — `flutter_markdown` is
  confirmed discontinued by its own publisher), Time Sensitive approval
  notifications, an operator-adjustable Face ID app-lock gate wrapping the entire
  app root, haptic feedback on six key events (phone + watch), live search/filter
  across Chat and Feed, and a fix for the Dashboard's "Unread"/"Pending approvals"
  rows previously doing nothing on tap.
  - **Verified**: everything above via the automated suite — `flutter analyze`
    clean, full `flutter test` suite passing (360/360, zero regressions, zero
    skipped tests) — consistent with this spec's own scoping to avoid anything
    that could only be proven on a physical device.
  - **Verified via `xcodebuild`, not on real hardware**: the watch-side haptic
    additions (`ApprovalsView.swift`/`WatchDataStore.swift`) compile cleanly
    (`xcodebuild -workspace Runner.xcworkspace -scheme WatchApp -sdk
    watchsimulator` → `BUILD SUCCEEDED`, both before and after the changes).
    Whether they actually *feel* right on a wrist has not been checked.
  - **Not verified — needs a physical device**: (1) the long-answer
    scroll-performance scenario (profiling a ~5000-character answer for dropped
    frames) — Clarifications (2026-08-14) scoped this to a manual/qualitative
    check specifically because it cannot be proven by `flutter test`, and no
    device pass has happened yet; (2) Time Sensitive delivery actually
    surviving a real Focus mode (iOS Focus modes have no meaningful Simulator
    equivalent); (3) the Face ID app-lock's actual biometric prompts — every
    automated test exercises the injected `authenticate` fake, never
    `local_auth`'s real platform channel; (4) all six phone-side haptics'
    actual feel, same caveat as approvals confirmation/device-removal haptics
    elsewhere in this document.
  - One behavior change worth calling out explicitly rather than letting it be
    discovered later: with app-lock enabled, an approval notification's
    Approve/Deny action can no longer resolve until the app itself is
    unlocked, because `HomeShell` — where the notification-response handler is
    wired — does not mount at all until `AppLockGate` authenticates. This is
    the intended, more conservative posture (a locked phone should not be able
    to approve a network change), not a regression, but it is a real change in
    what "tap Approve from the lock screen" does once app-lock is turned on.
